Forge is the Materials Data Facility Python package to interface and leverage the MDF Data Discovery service. Forge allows users to perform simple queries and facilitiates moving and synthesizing results.

# Installation

```
pip install mdf_forge
```

### For Developers
```
git clone https://github.com/materials-data-facility/forge.git
cd forge
pip install -e .
```

# Documentation and examples
Forge documentation can be found on [Read the Docs](https://mdf-forge.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/materials-data-facility/forge/tree/master/docs/).
Tutorials and examples can be found in the `docs` directory. The Jupyter notebooks can be viewed on GitHub or run interactively with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install).
