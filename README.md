Forge is the Materials Data Facility Python package to interface and leverage the MDF Data Discovery service. Forge allows users to perform simple queries and facilitiates moving and synthesizing results.

# Installation

```
pip install mdf_forge
```

### For Developers
```
git clone https://github.com/materials-data-facility/forge.git
